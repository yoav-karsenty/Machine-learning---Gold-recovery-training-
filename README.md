# Machine-learning Gold recovery training-
In this project, My task is to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. I have the data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters. 
In Order to do that, I need to:  
1. Prepare the data
2. Perform data analysis
3. Develop and train a model.

# Demonstrated Skills :
1. Data cleaning and preparation 
2. Data visualisation 
3 Model Training
